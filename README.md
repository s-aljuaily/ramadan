## How to run locally
1. Download `index.html`

   - Then open: http://localhost:8080

## Why GitHub shows the code?
GitHub repository view shows the file contents (code). To show it as a website you must use GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a repo and upload `index.html` to the root.
2. Go to Settings → Pages
3. Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: main → /(root)
4. Save, then open your Pages URL.

Tip: For best exporting, upload the template image from your device in the UI (avoids CORS).
